    <p><br><b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi </b><sup>[c] </sup>(2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) <sup>[2] </sup> was an Indian lawyer, <span style="color: blue;">anti-colonial nationalists</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">political ethicist</span>who employed <span style="color: blue;">nonviolent resistance</span> to lead the successful <span style="color: blue;">campaign for India's independence</span> from <span style="color: blue;">British rule</span>. He inspired movements for <span style="color: blue;">civil rights</span>and freedom across the world. The honorific <span style="color: blue;">Mahātmā </span> (from <span style="color: blue;">Sanskrit</span>, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in <span style="color: blue;">South Africa </span> in 1914, is now used throughout the world. <sup>[3]</sup> <br></p>

<p><br>Born and raised in a <span style="color: blue;">Hindu </span> family in coastal <span style="color: blue;">Gujarat</span>, Gandhi trained in the law at the <span style="color: blue;">Inner Temple</span> in London and was <span style="color: blue;">called to the bar</span>at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax. <br></p>

<p><br>Assuming leadership of the <span style="color: blue;">Indian National Congress </span> in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending <span style="color: blue;">untouchability</span>, and, above all, achieving <span style="color: blue;">swaraj</span> or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short <i><span style="color: blue;">dhoti</span></i> woven with <span style="color: blue;">hand-spun</span> yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a <span style="color: blue;">self-sufficient residential community</span>, to eat simple food, and undertake <span style="color: blue;">long fasts</span> as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed <span style="color: blue;">salt tax</span> with the 400 km (250 mi) <span style="color: blue;">Dandi Salt March</span>in 1930 and in calling for the British to <span style="color: blue;">quit India</span> in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India. <br></p>
